            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p class="history">I started to play piano at the age of 8, though initially, it wasn't my choice but my parents' decision to provide me with enriching after-school activities. Music became a significant part of my education journey, alongside my regular schooling.

               During my early years at music school, I was immersed in the world of classical piano. While my teachers focused on lesser-known pieces to challenge us technically, I yearned to play the famous compositions that had captured my heart - pieces like Für Elise, Turkish March, and The Entertainer.

               The turning point in my musical journey came after graduating from music school. Free from academic constraints, I began exploring the music I truly loved. I started arranging popular songs and diving into "fun" classical pieces. My repertoire expanded to include modern arrangements of songs like Hallelujah, Bohemian Rhapsody, Apologize, and River Flows in You.

               It was during this period of musical freedom that I discovered my true passion for the piano. I started sharing my music on YouTube, creating my own arrangements, and developing my unique style. The community's response was overwhelming, especially when I began incorporating creative elements into my performances.

               Today, I'm deeply grateful for this musical journey and the amazing community that supports me. I believe that music, especially piano, is a limitless adventure where there's always something new to learn and explore. Remember, the key to enjoying music is playing what resonates with your heart!</p>
